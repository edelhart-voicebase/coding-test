    "transcript": " the men on one side and the women on the other who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry. \n\"Just look at the masterl A regular eagle he is!\" loudly remarked the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways. \nThe count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her pow- erful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance.",
