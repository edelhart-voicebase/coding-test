    "transcript": "officer. \"Have a little fun to pass the time.\" \n\"Crew, to your gunsl\" commanded the of- ficer. \nIn a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading. \n\"One!\" came the command. \nNumber one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke showing the spot where it burst. \nThe faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound.",
