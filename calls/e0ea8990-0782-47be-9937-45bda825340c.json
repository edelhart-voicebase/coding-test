    "transcript": "those wretches 1\" gasped Kutuzov to the regimental commander, pointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to pun- ish him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across Kutiizov's suite like a flock of little birds. \nThe French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutuzov, were firing at him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg; several soldiers fell, and a second lieu- tenant who was holding the flag let it fall from his hands.",
