    "transcript": "Pierre was sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quiv- ered and shook as if in an ague. \n\"Ah, my friend!\" said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was in his voice a sincer- ity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it before. \"How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am near sixty, dear friend ... I too . . . All will end in death, all! Death is awful . . .\" and he burst into tears. \nAnna Mik",
