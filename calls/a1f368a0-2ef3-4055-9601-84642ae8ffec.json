Higher up stood some Russian infantry, neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the flee- ing crowd. A mounted general separated him- self from the infantry and approached Kuttizov. Of Kutrizov's suite only four remained. They were all pale and exchanged looks in silence. \n\"St",
